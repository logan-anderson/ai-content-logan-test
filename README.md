# Content Suggestion BOT

> A content suggestion robot powered by ChatGPT

This bot will make github suggestion comments to update the contents of a file in a PR

When ever a user comments `ai fix: <filename>` or `ai fix: <file1>, <file2>` the bot will respond with a suggestion for the contents of the file.

## Example

![Example](http://res.cloudinary.com/forestry-demo/image/upload/v1688483462/blog-media/supercharge-markdown-blog/Screenshot_2023-07-04_at_11.03.24_AM_bfqnld.png)

## Usage

This bot can be used in two ways:

1. As a Github app (self-hosted)
2. As a Github action

A github app can be hosted on any hosting platform that supports node.js, it can be also be hosted in a serverless environment such as AWS Lambda or Netlify Functions.

> NOTE: Serverless functions sometime have timeout limitations or sometimes stop after a request responds with e 202 status code (This is the behavior in vercel). This may cause the bot to fail if the OpenAI API takes too long to respond.

A Github action is hosted by Github and will run on every comment to the repo, the action will only respond to comments on a PR and only if the comment follows the correct format.

The bot responds to a comment in the format `ai fix: <filename>` or `ai fix: <file1>, <file2>`. A prompt can also be added by adding a adding `prompt: <prompt>` after the filename to the to the comment.

For example:

```
ai fix: README.md
prompt: Fix only the spelling and grammar errors in the README
```

## Github app Usage

We do not provide a hosted version of the Github app so you will need to self-host it. You can self-host it on on most hosting platforms we have setup and tested it on netlify (Functions) and render.

### Self-hosting on Netlify

> NOTE: functions are limited to a 10 second timeout on Netlify. This may cause the bot to fail if the OpenAI API takes too long to respond.
> To avoid this a background function can be used instead of the normal function. Netlify background functions are only available on the paid tier.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/tinacms/ai-content)

This will clone the repo to your github account and deploy it to Netlify. [See below](#env-variables) for the required env variables.

### Self-hosting on Render

> NOTE: when using the free tier you may get frequent 503 errors due to the app being put to sleep. To avoid this you can upgrade to the paid tier.

## ENV Variables

Before deploying you will need to set the following environment variables:

```env
# The Github App ID
APP_ID=***

# The Client ID of the Github App
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID***

# The Client Secret of the Github App
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=***

# The private key of the Github App (Copy and pasted from the .pem file)
PRIVATE_KEY=***

# The webhook secret of the Github App (User generated and pasted into the Github App)

```

## Github action Usage

When using as a Github action it will run on every comment to the repo, the bot will only respond to comments on a PR and only if the comment follows the format `ai fix: <filename>` or `ai fix: <file1>, <file2>`.
