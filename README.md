# Content Suggestion BOT

> A content suggestion robot powered by ChatGPT

This bot will make github suggestion comments to update the contents of a file in a PR

When ever a user comments `ai fix: <filename>` or `ai fix: <file1>, <file2>` the bot will respond with a suggestion for the contents of the file.

## Usage

This bot can be used in three ways:

1. As a Github action
2. As a Github app (self-hosted)

The easiest way to get started is to use the hosted Github app but do to so you will need to expose your openai api key as a [github variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables). While variables are not encrypted they are only exposed accessible to Github apps/developers that have access to variables. If you do not want to expose your api key you can use the Github action or self-hosted Github app.

Github app and Github action are both hosted by Github and will run on every comment to the repo, the bot will only respond to comments on a PR and only if the comment follows the format `ai fix: <filename>` or `ai fix: <file1>, <file2>`. A prompt can also be added by adding a adding `prompt: <prompt>` after the filename to the to the comment.

For example:

```
ai fix: README.md
prompt: Fix only the spelling and grammar errors in the README
```
